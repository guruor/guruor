Hey, I am a Backend Developer with 8 years of experience based in India.

I specialize in developing and managing complex backend architectures for robust digital products. My journey includes leading development teams at [CoinSwitch](https://coinswitch.co/), [UrbanPiper](https://www.urbanpiper.com/), and [Cartoon Mango Digital](https://cartoonmango.com/), with a strong focus on quality and delivery. I am passionate about automating workflows to enhance operational efficiency and have mentored and led teams of all sizes.

I am a huge fan of open-source and [have contributed to various projects](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Aguruor&type=pullrequests).
